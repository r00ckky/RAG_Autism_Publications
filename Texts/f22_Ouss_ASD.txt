The study focused on using behavior and interaction imaging to predict autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID) in high-risk infants with West Syndrome (WS). The researchers recorded 32 infants with WS and 19 typically developing controls during a standardized mother-infant interaction at 9 months of age. They analyzed infant hand movements, speech turn-taking, and motherese to assess whether multimodal social signals and interactional synchrony at 9 months could predict outcomes at 4 years. The best machine learning model achieved 76.47% accuracy classifying WS vs. typically developing controls and 81.25% accuracy classifying WS+ (infants who developed ASD/ID) vs. WS- (infants who did not develop ASD/ID). The study found that behavioral and interaction imaging was able to predict ASD/ID in high-risk children with WS.

The introduction highlighted the potential of affective computing in exploring psychiatric conditions, particularly in identifying reliable indicators of neurodevelopmental disorders in high-risk populations during the first year of life to recommend early interventions. The study focused on WS, a rare epileptic encephalopathy with a high risk of ASD and/or ID outcomes, and aimed to analyze the quality and dynamics of early interactions using behavior and interaction imaging.

The aim was to explore whether multimodal social signals and interpersonal synchrony of infant-mother interactions at 9 months could predict outcomes. The study enrolled 39 infants with WS, of which 32 patients had detailed follow-up data. Additionally, 19 typically developing infants were included for comparison. The neurodevelopmental outcomes focused on intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The study used various assessments including the Brunet-Lézine developmental examination for ID and autism diagnostic interviews and rating scales for ASD. The diagnoses of ASD and/or ID at age 4 were based on a consensus approach using direct assessment of the child by a clinician with expertise in autism as well as clinical information from the assessments.

The study involved video recordings of infant-mother interactions at 9-12 months of age during a play session. The interactions were recorded using synchronized cameras and audio recordings. The study also employed machine learning to classify WS vs. typically developing controls and WS+ (infants who developed ASD/ID) vs. WS- (infants who did not develop ASD/ID).

The figure in the original text was a pipeline of the machine learning approach to classify WS vs. typically developing controls. It included audio and video features extraction and the classification process.The study involved a standardized mother-infant interaction at 9 months of age, which included three sequences: free play without a toy, free play with a toy, and the mother singing to her baby. Video and audio recordings were made during these interactions. The study used these recordings to analyze infant hand movements, speech turn-taking, and motherese. The researchers employed vision computing to process infant hand movements and audio computing to extract speech turn-taking and motherese.

The study's findings suggest that multimodal social signal processing during early interactions at 9 months significantly predicted the development of ASD or severe to moderate ID at 4 years of age in high-risk children with WS. The study also highlighted the importance of synchrony and reciprocity during early interactions, aligning with previous research on the risk of ASD or neurodevelopmental disorders during the first year of life. The study's approach of combining multimodal automatized assessment of social signal processing with infants at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders shows promise in identifying and assessing clinical features that are difficult to detect.
