The study aimed to develop and test a novel video-based approach, the Video-Referenced Infant Rating System for Autism (VIRSA), to detect autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in infancy. The VIRSA demonstrated satisfactory reliability and validity, with lower scores for children ultimately diagnosed with ASD compared to typically developing children by 12 months of age. By 18 months, VIRSA scores identified all children diagnosed with ASD at that age, as well as 78% of children diagnosed at 36 months. The study suggests that the VIRSA has the potential to reduce disparities in communities with limited access to screening. The figure in the text likely represented the VIRSA web-based application, and the table data probably included the results of the VIRSA scores at different ages.The study focuses on the early detection of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in infants, as symptoms typically emerge within the first three years of life. Despite this, the average age of diagnosis remains over 4 years, indicating a need for earlier detection. One of the barriers to prompt recognition of ASD is the measurement, with existing measures showing low reliability for screening in diverse samples. The study aims to address this by developing a new instrument, the Video-Referenced Infant Rating System for Autism (VIRSA), which utilizes video examples to reduce subjective interpretations. This approach aims to improve the accuracy of early ASD screening, potentially reducing disparities in communities with limited access to screening. The study builds on previous efforts by incorporating video examples to provide a common naturalistic standard for comparison. The VIRSA demonstrated satisfactory reliability and validity, with lower scores for children ultimately diagnosed with ASD compared to typically developing children by 12 months of age.

The VIRSA was developed using video from participants in a longitudinal infant sibling study and then validated on an independent sample of infants. Videos used in the VIRSA were drawn from an archive of over 300,000 minutes of digitized video recorded in a clinical laboratory setting, depicting infants and parents playing together with age-appropriate toys. Social behaviors, including smiles, vocalizations, and eye contact, were coded by research assistants using a previously validated coding scheme. The VIRSA demonstrated satisfactory reliability and validity, with lower scores for children ultimately diagnosed with ASD compared to typically developing children by 12 months of age. By 18 months, VIRSA scores identified all children diagnosed with ASD at that age, as well as 78% of children diagnosed at 36 months.

The figure in the text likely represented the VIRSA web-based application, and the table data probably included the results of the VIRSA scores at different ages.

The table data likely included the results of the VIRSA scores at different ages, showing a significant group effect, with the ASD videos rated lower compared to videos of children with non-ASD developmental concerns and typically developing children. The figure in the text likely represented the VIRSA web-based application, which was developed using a large library of video clips depicting a wide range of social-communication abilities and relying solely on video in the ratings, with no written descriptions of behavior.

By 18 months, VIRSA scores identified all children diagnosed with ASD at that age, as well as 78% of children diagnosed at 36 months. The VIRSA web-based application presented pairs of videos depicting differing degrees of social competence, accompanied by the prompt, "which video is more like your child's interaction with you on a typical day?" The study involved 110 infants, 73 with an older sibling with ASD and 37 with no known family history of autism. Twenty-one children in the familial high-risk group received a diagnosis of ASD, whereas none of the low-risk children did.

The figure in the text likely represented the modeled parent VIRSA scores for each group between 6 and 18 months, showing a main effect for group. The table data probably included the results of the VIRSA scores at different ages, showing significant differences in VIRSA scores between the ASD and comparison groups at 12 and 18 months.

The study also conducted ROC analyses on VIRSA scores at each age, predicting a binary 36-month outcome, and found that the VIRSA performed best at 18 months. The study discussed the sensitivity of 18-month VIRSA scores in predicting 36-month diagnosis and compared it to the sensitivity of clinical diagnostic assessment at 18 months reported in another study. The VIRSA's sensitivity was found to be impressive, especially considering the extended time course of development of ASD symptoms.

The study highlighted the potential of the VIRSA in early detection of ASD, especially for children who may not yet be showing signs of ASD for parents to rate.The study further examined the Video-Referenced Infant Rating System for Autism (VIRSA) by conducting ROC analyses at 18 months, which successfully identified all eight children diagnosed with ASD by that age, with no false negatives. The sensitivity of the VIRSA at 18 months was found to be comparable to or better than existing measures, suggesting its potential as an adjunct in identifying toddlers in need of referral for an ASD evaluation. However, its specificity and positive predictive value were lower than recommended standards, leading to over-identification of risk. Therefore, the study does not support the use of the VIRSA as a stand-alone ASD screener in infancy yet, and future studies could explore its use in a two-stage screening process to improve accuracy.

Additionally, the study examined various psychometric properties of the VIRSA, including strong test-retest reliability and significant correlations with ADOS-2 scores. It also highlighted the need to evaluate the VIRSA's psychometric properties in low-risk samples, as the predictive ability may differ in populations with varying ASD prevalence.

Despite its limitations, the study demonstrated the potential of developing a parent report instrument capable of identifying ASD risk in the first year of life and utilizing video to improve parent reporting of early development. The web-based, mobile-optimized application of the VIRSA was also emphasized as a step towards video- and web-based screening for ASD, with the potential to reduce disparities in communities with limited access to screening and initiate early intervention.The study aimed to develop and test a novel video-based approach, the Video-Referenced Infant Rating System for Autism (VIRSA), to detect autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in infancy.
