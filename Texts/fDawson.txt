Atypical postural control has been identified as an early feature of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), suggesting differences in motor function. This study focused on assessing midline head postural control in toddlers, aged 16-31 months, using computer vision analysis. The results revealed significant differences in the rate of head movements between toddlers with ASD and those without, particularly while watching movies depicting social and nonsocial stimuli. Toddlers with ASD exhibited a notably higher rate of head movement, indicating challenges in maintaining midline head position during attentional engagement. The use of digital phenotyping approaches, such as computer vision analysis, can enable more precise and objective characterization of early motor signatures, potentially offering new automated methods for early autism risk identification.

Motor delays in infants later diagnosed with ASD have been observed, including atypical movements, lower levels of positional symmetry, head lag, postural stiffness, and oral-motor abnormalities. Longitudinal research has also indicated poorer ability in maintaining midline head position in infants later diagnosed with ASD. These findings highlight the importance of early motor behaviors in identifying potential risk for ASD.The study focused on assessing midline head postural control in toddlers, aged 16-31 months, using computer vision analysis.

The study used computer vision analysis to characterize head movements that didn’t involve spontaneous or volitional orienting or turning away from the stimuli. Rather, the focus was on subtler midline head movements that are more likely related to postural stability. The study compared the behaviors of toddlers with ASD versus those without ASD while the children watched a series of dynamic movies involving different types of stimuli, including stimuli of both a social and nonsocial nature. While the children watched the movies, their head movements were automatically detected and tracked using landmarks on the participant’s face. The goal of this analysis was to quantify the rate of spontaneous head movements and to determine whether there were differences in this motor feature between young children with and without ASD.

The participants were 104 children between 16–31 months of age, with 22 of them having autism spectrum disorder. The non-ASD comparison group was comprised of 96 typically developing children and 8 children with language delay or developmental delay of clinical significance. Diagnostic evaluations to confirm ASD were based on the autism diagnostic observation scale-toddler (ADOS-T), and the mean IQ based on the Mullen Scales of Early Learning composite score for the ASD group was 63.58. The stimuli consisted of a series of brief developmentally-appropriate movies designed to elicit positive affect and engage the child’s attention, including cascading bubbles, a mechanical bunny, animal puppets interacting with each other, and a split screen showing a woman singing nursery rhymes and dynamic, noise-making toys.
