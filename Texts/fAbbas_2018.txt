The study aimed to develop a machine learning approach for early detection of autism by combining questionnaire and home video screening. Two algorithms were trained to identify autism, one based on short, structured parent-reported questionnaires and the other on tagging key behaviors from short, semi-structured home videos of children. A combination algorithm was used to merge the results into a single assessment of higher accuracy. The performance was validated in a controlled clinical study of 162 children, demonstrating significant accuracy improvement over standard screening tools. The findings suggest that a mobile, machine learning process is a reliable method for detecting autism outside of clinical settings. The study addressed the scarcity, sparsity, and imbalance of training data by applying novel feature selection, feature engineering, and feature encoding techniques. The final results are statistically limited and will benefit from future clinical studies to extend the sample size.

The figure likely presented the accuracy improvement over standard screening tools in measurements of AUC, sensitivity, and specificity.The study introduces two new machine learning screeners for the reliable and cost-effective early detection of autism. One screener is based on a short questionnaire answered by the parent, while the other identifies specific behaviors from short videos of the child within their natural environment. These screeners are designed to be completed in minutes and achieve higher accuracy than existing screeners. The questionnaire screener focuses on behavioral patterns similar to those probed by the Autism Diagnostic Interview – Revised (ADI-R), while the video screener keys on behavioral patterns similar to those probed in the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS).

The study addresses the scarcity, sparsity, and imbalance of training data by applying novel feature selection, feature engineering, and feature encoding techniques. It also presents a combination of the algorithms for a more powerful single screener and generalizes the algorithms to be non-binary, allowing for an "inconclusive" determination in more challenging cases. The classifiers were applied to screen children in a clinical study using the Cognoa app, demonstrating their reliability outside of clinical settings.

The approach involved training two independent machine learning classifiers and combining their outputs into a single screening assessment. The classifiers were trained using historical item-level ADI-R score-sheets and ADOS instrument score-sheets with labels corresponding to established clinical diagnoses. The study also discusses the impact of confounding factors on machine learning algorithms in this context and outlines creative machine learning methods designed to overcome these challenges.
