The study aimed to investigate the vocal patterns in infants with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), focusing on canonical babbling status and vocalization frequency. Canonical babbling is a crucial milestone in speech development, typically established by 10 months of age. The research retrospectively analyzed video recordings of vocalizations from 37 infants at 9–12 and 15–18 months, 23 of whom were later diagnosed with ASD. The findings revealed that infants later diagnosed with ASD exhibited low rates of canonical babbling and low volubility compared to typically developing infants, indicating that early vocal patterns may serve as a valuable component for early screening and diagnosis of ASD.

The study underscores the significance of early intervention for positive outcomes in children with ASD. Early identification of atypical behaviors during infancy could significantly impact the age of diagnosis and subsequent initiation of intervention. Currently, the majority of children with ASD can be reliably diagnosed at the age of two years, but there is a need for early identification of atypical behaviors to facilitate timely intervention.The study emphasizes the importance of early detection of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in infants. It highlights the need for identifying atypical behaviors during infancy to facilitate timely intervention. The research focuses on retrospective video analyses of infants recorded at home and later diagnosed with ASD, aiming to identify potential communication markers of ASD within the first year of life. The study specifically examines canonical babbling as a key milestone in typical development, noting that infants later diagnosed with ASD exhibited low rates of canonical babbling and low volubility compared to typically developing infants. This suggests that early vocal patterns may serve as valuable components for early screening and diagnosis of ASD.

The study aimed to compare canonical babbling status and volubility between the two groups at 9–12 months and 15–18 months of age.

Hypothesis 1 focused on the likelihood of infants later diagnosed with ASD being in the canonical stage at each age. The findings revealed that TD infants were significantly more likely to have reached the canonical babbling stage compared to infants later diagnosed with ASD at both 9–12 months and 15–18 months.

Hypothesis 2 examined the differences in canonical babbling ratios between infants with ASD and TD infants. The results showed that infants later diagnosed with ASD demonstrated significantly lower canonical babbling ratios independent of the canonical stage criterion, with a significant main effect for diagnostic category and age.

Hypothesis 3 investigated the total vocalizations (volubility) of infants with ASD compared to TD infants at both age ranges. The analysis indicated that infants later diagnosed with ASD produced significantly fewer total vocalizations (lower volubility) at both 9–12 months and 15–18 months compared to TD infants.

The study utilized statistical analyses, including log odds ratios, mixed ANOVA, and effect size measures to compare the vocal patterns between infants with ASD and TD infants.

The analysis revealed that infants later diagnosed with ASD exhibited significantly lower volubility than TD infants at both age ranges, indicating a potential early marker for ASD. Additionally, a logistic regression analysis was conducted to assess whether canonical babbling status and volubility could reliably predict later diagnosis status. The results showed that as a set, canonical babbling status and volubility reliably predicted later diagnosis, with a 75% overall prediction success. However, further examination revealed that none of the predictor variables significantly contributed to the prediction of group membership at an individual level, possibly due to the high level of relation among the predictor variables. The study provides valuable insights into early markers for ASD and the potential utility of volubility and canonical babbling status in predicting later diagnosis.The new text discusses the findings of the study, presenting hypotheses and their corresponding findings related to the vocal patterns in infants later diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and typically developing (TD) infants.
