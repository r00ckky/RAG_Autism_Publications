The study focused on early screening for high-risk autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in infants and toddlers using the still-face paradigm (SFP). The SFP was used to measure social behaviors in high-risk ASD and typical development groups. Machine learning methods were employed to establish models for early ASD screening. The results indicated significant differences in social behaviors between the two groups during the face-to-face interaction and still-face episodes. The accuracy of support vector machine classification for the still-face episode was 83.35%. The study concluded that using the SFP for high-risk children before the age of 2 can effectively predict the clinical diagnosis of ASD at the age of 2. The screening model constructed using support vector machine based on the still-face episode of the SFP was found to be the best. The study also highlighted the potential value of the SFP in high-risk ASD screening and its convenience for self-screening at home.The study focuses on early screening for high-risk autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in infants and toddlers. Early intervention is crucial for improving patient prognosis, but the average age of ASD diagnosis is still around 40 months. Therefore, early detection and effective intervention are essential. Understanding early childhood behaviors of ASD can facilitate early intervention and improve prognosis. The lack of social abilities is prominent in early life for children with ASD, and symptoms are usually present in young children at the age of 1–2 years. The study aims to focus on the differences in early social behavior between high-risk and typical development groups.

The still-face paradigm (SFP) is used to measure social behavior in the high-risk ASD and typical development groups. The SFP tests infants’ emotion regulation ability and social expectations in social interaction. It has been found that children with ASD employ simpler regulatory behavior and have difficulties in developing socioemotional ability. The study uses the SFP to measure social behavior in the high-risk and typical development groups.

Machine learning methods have been applied in previous studies to build models for early screening of ASD based on biological indicators, such as electroencephalogram and brain images, with an accuracy of more than 80%. The study aims to build a model for early screening of ASD based on social behavioral indicators.

The participants in the study include 45 infants and toddlers with high-risk ASD and 43 infants and toddlers with typical development. The study was approved by the medical ethics committee, and all subjects' guardians agreed to participate and signed informed consent forms.

The study aims to establish models for early ASD screening and highlights the potential value of the SFP in high-risk ASD screening and its convenience for self-screening at home.

The participants included 45 infants and toddlers with high-risk ASD and 43 infants and toddlers with typical development. The study used the Gesell Developmental Scale to assess developmental levels and the severity of ASD symptoms in the high-risk group. Video recordings during the SFP were analyzed to observe behavioral changes in the high-risk and typical development groups.

The SFP consists of three episodes: the baseline episode (face-to-face interaction), the still-face episode, and the reunion episode. The still-face episode was found to elicit behavioral changes in infants and toddlers, such as a reduction in eye gaze and positive facial emotion and an increase in negative emotion. The study used coding indicators to analyze behaviors during the SFP, and the observer XT 12 behavioral observation and recording analysis system was employed for coding.

The diagnostic evaluation of children in the HR group at 2 years of age was conducted using the Autism Diagnosis Interview-R (ADI-R) and the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS). The study employed machine learning methods to construct models for early ASD screening based on the HR and TD groups.

In conclusion, the study contributes to the understanding of early screening methods for high-risk ASD and provides insights into the social behaviors and developmental differences between high-risk ASD and typical development groups in early childhood.The new text discusses the social communication impairments and stereotyped behaviors in infants and toddlers with high-risk autism spectrum disorder (ASD). It highlights the differences in social behaviors between high-risk and typical development groups during the still-face paradigm (SFP) episode. The study also employs machine learning methods, including support vector machine (SVM), naïve Bayes, and random forest, to construct models for early ASD screening. The SVM model is found to have the best performance, especially for the still-face episode. However, there are challenges in differentiating non-ASD from ASD groups, and the classification accuracy does not show regularity with month age. The study acknowledges limitations in sample size and age matching between the high-risk and typical development groups and emphasizes the need for further research with expanded sample sizes and controlled physiological and psychological ages.

The study aims to promote the widespread application of the SFP for early ASD screening and advocates for a more objective, standardized, and convenient self-screening method at home. The data availability statement and ethics statement are provided, and the author contributions and funding sources are outlined. The study also includes references to previous research on early identification and diagnosis of ASD.
