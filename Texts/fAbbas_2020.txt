The study presents a multi-modular, machine learning-based assessment of autism for children aged 18-72 months in the United States. The assessment comprises three complementary modules: a 4-minute parent-report questionnaire delivered via a mobile app, a list of key behaviors identified from 2-minute, semi-structured home videos of children, and a 2-minute questionnaire presented to the clinician at the time of clinical assessment. The assessment demonstrated reliability in a blinded, multi-site clinical study, outperforming baseline screeners in terms of sensitivity and specificity. The incidence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) has increased in recent years, impacting 1 in 59 children. Early diagnosis within the first few years of life significantly improves the outlook for children with autism. However, the median age of diagnosis in the United States is 52 months, leading to delayed access to effective behavioral therapies. The paper presents improvements to two previously published automated autism assessment modules and introduces a new module intended for completion in a primary care setting. The new module is based on a questionnaire answered by a clinician after examining the child and talking to the parent. The study demonstrates that these three modules are fast and easy to administer, providing a streamlined approach to autism diagnosis in young children.

The study compares the outputs of the assessment modules to those of three screening instruments: the modified checklist for autism in toddlers, revised (M-CHAT-R), the social responsiveness scale - second edition (SRS), and the child behavior checklist (CBCL). The study uses de-identified historical patient records and medical instrument score sheet data for training the predictive models underlying each of the autism assessment modules. The diagnostic accuracy of the modules was measured using data from a multi-site blinded clinical validation study, and the sample breakdown by cohort, age group, and diagnosis for all data used for training and validation is provided.

The table shows the dataset breakdown by age group and condition for each of the sources of training data and for the clinical validation sample. Machine learning model training was stratified by age group. Clinical validation 2016 and 2017 samples are used together to evaluate performance of the parent and video modules in this paper, while the clinician module was only available for the clinical 2017 dataset.

The methodology section explains important aspects of the machine learning methodology common to the classifiers underlying each of the three assessment modules. It details the training procedure, feature selection, and optimization, as well as the use of gradient boosted decision trees for all three modules. The machine learning models were trained using historical patient records, with a focus on application in non-clinical settings aimed for brevity, ease-of-use, and/or unsupervised parent usage at home. New strategies to address biases are discussed, resulting in significant improvements in accuracy compared to previous work.The study focuses on a multi-modular, machine learning-based assessment of autism for children aged 18-72 months in the United States.

The study also discusses the methodology for training diagnostic assessment algorithms capable of outputting one of three possible outcomes: "positive", "negative", or "inconclusive". It outlines the process involving three separate machine learning training runs to support the inconclusive determination. The study details the initial feature selection for the parental module and the empirical post-hoc feature selection refinement. It also explains the video assessment module and the challenges associated with making predictions based on short videos uploaded by parents.

It introduces a new module for primary care settings and compares the outputs of the assessment modules to existing screening instruments.

The study also introduces a module to screen for autism using questionnaire responses from a clinician, and the questions for the clinician were selected in a similar manner as used for the parental module. The responses from both the parent and the clinician are used in a machine learning module in the same manner as described for the parental questionnaire. The study also discusses the feature selection process for creating a brief clinician questionnaire appropriate for the primary care setting.

Due to limitations on available training data, the study explains that it is not possible to train a single combined model that uses the input features from each of the parental, video, and clinician modules. Instead, responses from the modules are each considered to be a probability and combined mathematically using a specific equation. The study details the process of combining the module responses and determining "inconclusive" outcomes.
