3,4,"What are Stereotypical and maladaptive behaviors in Autism Spectrum, how are these detected and managed","Stereotypical behaviors in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are repetitive movements or actions that serve no apparent purpose, such as hand flapping, rocking back and forth, or spinning objects. Maladaptive behaviors in ASD are actions that are harmful, disruptive, or interfere with daily functioning, like aggression, self-injury, or severe tantrums.

These behaviors can be detected through careful observation, standardized assessments, and reports from parents or caregivers. Managing these behaviors often involves a combination of interventions such as Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), speech therapy, occupational therapy, social skills training, and medication when necessary. Creating individualized behavior plans tailored to the specific needs of each individual with ASD is crucial for effective management.","The lack of social abilities is prominent in early life for children with ASD, and symptoms are usually present in young children at the age of 1–2 years.

New strategies to address biases are discussed, resulting in significant improvements in accuracy compared to previous work.The study focuses on a multi-modular, machine learning-based assessment of autism for children aged 18-72 months in the United States. The assessment includes a 4-minute parent-report questionnaire delivered via a mobile app, a list of key behaviors identified from 2-minute, semi-structured home videos of children, and a 2-minute questionnaire presented to the clinician at the time of clinical assessment. The assessment demonstrated reliability in a blinded, multi-site clinical study, outperforming baseline screeners in terms of sensitivity and specificity. The study introduces a new module intended for completion in a primary care setting, based on a questionnaire answered by a clinician after examining the child and talking to the parent

The figure in the original text depicted the pipeline of the machine learning approach, including audio and video features extraction and the classification process. However, the specific details of the figure were not described in the remaining text.The study focused on using behavior and interaction imaging to predict autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID) in high-risk infants with West Syndrome (WS). The researchers recorded 32 infants with WS and 19 typically developing controls during a standardized mother-infant interaction at 9 months of age. They analyzed infant hand movements, speech turn-taking, and motherese to assess whether multimodal social signals and interactional synchrony at 9 months could predict outcomes at 4 years. The best machine learning model achieved 76.47% accuracy classifying WS vs. typically developing controls and 81.25% accuracy classifying WS+ (infants who developed ASD/ID) vs. WS- (infants who did not develop ASD/ID). The study found that behavioral and interaction imaging was able to predict ASD/ID in high-risk children with WS

The study establishes and trains the deep learning model for ASD detection using the eGeMAPS data and the auto-encoder (AE) trained through semi-supervised learning. The machine learning models, such as support vector machines (SVMs), bidirectional long short-term memory (BLSTM), and joint optimized BLSTM, are constructed and evaluated through five-fold cross-validation.

The aim was to explore whether multimodal social signals and interpersonal synchrony of infant-mother interactions at 9 months could predict outcomes. The study enrolled 39 infants with WS, of which 32 patients had detailed follow-up data. Additionally, 19 typically developing infants were included for comparison. The neurodevelopmental outcomes focused on intellectual disability (ID) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The study used various assessments including the Brunet-Lézine developmental examination for ID and autism diagnostic interviews and rating scales for ASD. The diagnoses of ASD and/or ID at age 4 were based on a consensus approach using direct assessment of the child by a clinician with expertise in autism as well as clinical information from the assessments

The study involved video recordings of infant-mother interactions at 9-12 months of age during a play session. The interactions were recorded using synchronized cameras and audio recordings. The study also employed machine learning to classify WS vs. typically developing controls and WS+ (infants who developed ASD/ID) vs. WS- (infants who did not develop ASD/ID). The machine learning model achieved 76.47% accuracy classifying WS vs. typically developing controls and 81.25% accuracy classifying WS+ vs. WS-.

The study's findings suggest that multimodal social signal processing during early interactions at 9 months significantly predicted the development of ASD or severe to moderate ID at 4 years of age in high-risk children with WS. The study also highlighted the importance of synchrony and reciprocity during early interactions, aligning with previous research on the risk of ASD or neurodevelopmental disorders during the first year of life. The study's approach of combining multimodal automatized assessment of social signal processing with infants at risk for neurodevelopmental disorders shows promise in identifying and assessing clinical features that are difficult to detect. However, the study's limitations include the overall sample size and missing data during video recording, which may have impacted the power of the machine learning methods. The study was funded by the EADS Foundation, the Agence Nationale de la Recherche, and the Groupement de Recherche en Psychiatrie. The sponsors had no involvement in the study design, data analysis, or interpretation of the results.The study focused on using behavior and interaction imaging to predict autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID) in high-risk infants with West Syndrome (WS). The researchers recorded 32 infants with WS and 19 typically developing controls during a standardized mother-infant interaction at 9 months of age

The figure in the original text depicted the pipeline of the machine learning approach, including audio and video features extraction and the classification process. However, the specific details of the figure were not described in the remaining text.The study focused on using behavior and interaction imaging to predict autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and intellectual disability (ID) in high-risk infants with West Syndrome (WS). The researchers recorded 32 infants with WS and 19 typically developing controls during a standardized mother-infant interaction at 9 months of age. They analyzed infant hand movements, speech turn-taking, and motherese to assess whether multimodal social signals and interactional synchrony at 9 months could predict outcomes at 4 years. The best machine learning model achieved 76.47% accuracy classifying WS vs. typically developing controls and 81.25% accuracy classifying WS+ (infants who developed ASD/ID) vs. WS- (infants who did not develop ASD/ID). The study found that behavioral and interaction imaging was able to predict ASD/ID in high-risk children with WS

The study utilized behavior and interaction imaging to analyze early interactions between infants with West Syndrome (WS) and their mothers. The researchers extracted various features from the interactions, including vocalizations, pauses, and synchrony ratios. They also developed a classifier to differentiate between motherese and non-motherese speech. Additionally, machine learning was employed to predict outcomes, achieving 76.47% accuracy in classifying WS versus typically developing controls and 81.25% accuracy in classifying infants who developed ASD/ID versus those who did not"
